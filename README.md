# JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms

A curated collection of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **unit tests** implemented in pure **JavaScript** for educational purposes.

## ðŸ“¦ Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
- **LinkedList** â€” singly linked list with basic operations
- **Custom Map** â€” map-like key/value store
- **HashTable (Open Addressing)** â€” open addressing with linear probing
- **StackWithLinkedList** â€” based on a custom `LinkedList`
- **StackWIthArray** â€” based on native JavaScript arrays
- **QueueWithLinkedList** â€” based on a custom `LinkedList`
- **QueueWithArray** â€” based on native JavaScript arrays

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Binary Tree** â€” simple binary search tree implementation

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton** â€” private static field singleton pattern

## ðŸ§® Algorithms

- **Binary Search** â€” efficient search in sorted arrays
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** â€” shortest path in weighted directed graphs

## ðŸ§ª Testing

All implementations are accompanied by **unit tests** written in **Jest**
to validate correctness and improve understanding.
